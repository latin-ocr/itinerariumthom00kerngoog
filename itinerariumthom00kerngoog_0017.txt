PREFA OE. vii

has it been composed, but beneath the tenta of war, where my busy peu
found no peace from the ominous clangor of the hoarse trumpet, and the
loud roll of the battle-dmm where my ear was stunned by the dreadful
thuoder of the cannon, and the fatal lesden hail hissed round the paper

’ on which I was writing.” These words are in his dedication to Ormond.

Curre does not seem to have been with Devereux when the latter died at

Prague in October or November, 1639, Ι should, therefore, suppose
that he was then in Mente, superintending his publication.
The appearance of the book created him enemies amougst the Irish in

Germany, who did uot wish that Carve, on the strength of a single allu'·

’ sion in St Bernard’s “Life of St. Malachy,'' should calumniata his

country. There were letters, therefore, written to and of him, in
which he was admonished to recant what he had said of ireland3 and
lampoons against him were privately distributed amongst the Irish sol-

he cared for no evidence beyond the asserticn of St. Bernard.

In April, 1640, appeared what is called the second edition of the Itine-

von Verburg, Deacon of Ascbaffenburg. This was published by Bal·
thazar Kuntz, at Mente, in consequence of the great demand for the
work, which had received the highest success. In the following Sep-

differing from the first in the addition of a 35th chapter at the end, and
the insertion of the second and third epitapbs on Wallensteiu (p. 49).
On the publication of this, he was appointed Chaplain General of all
the English, Scotch,aud1rishforces, and in that capacity continued to
serve with the army, notwithstanding the death of Devereux. In May,

words in his dedication to the Marchioness of Ormond, Iam disposed
to believe there was afourth edition of the first part published simulta-
neously with the second part. In the second parthe performed the
