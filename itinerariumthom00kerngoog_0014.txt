haa len. 1 think that ho would have wielded tho sword at least as weh
ee the pen. Os hie life scarcely anything is recorded but what appears
in hia worke; his name ie almost entirely unknown in biographical oom-
poeitioue, and when mentionedis accompanied by erroneous statementa.

Thomas Corve, whose correct name is (larue or Oarew, and whom
the Irish called O'Corrain, was born in Tipperary, at the village of
Mobernen, in the year 1589-90. For his family he ia prond to claim a
hindred lineege with its hmous Anglo-Normau namesake3 and to refuto
a contemptnous caeenion, made by an opponent, that hie grand nephew
Connel was “ e mechanio,’' he etatae that sir Roas Carew, his brother,
was married to the great Clarendon’s sister, Lady Hyde; audaleoboasts

· ot⁴ hieanoeetor Sir Thomas Oarew, who in the iitleenth century had held

high authority iu Mnester. Hie sympathiea in many respecta were
anti-Irish, and, though shilled in the Gaelio tongue, he professes hie pre·
serenoe sor English.

His early yeare ecem to have been paseed amongst the Butlers, to
whom, ho aaye, he owed everytbingz and it ie not impossible his boy-
hood may have been spent in the Ormond family. Harria’ edition oi ,
Ware etetee that he was eduum at Oxford3 but I cannotiind a confir·
matiou ot* thia assertion, which is perhaps but a miaapprehenaion oi the
allusion made to Carvo in Wood’s “ Athenae Oxonieuaes.”‘ His writ-
ings do not indicate that hia learning was very extensive, and although
be writes Latin with fluenoy and freedom, hie language seems formed
. upon medieeval models os composition, rather than those of the Augus-
tan age.

He entered the Irish Romm Catholio prieathood, aad appears to have
been looeted in the diocese of Ieighlin. But the monotony of euch a
life could not long content his rootless epirit3 and, under pretence
of “ visiting some noble friends iu the Imperial Army,'’ and what he
calla the “ ardor juvandi inter milites proximi,’' he obtained e leave
of absence from his superior, the Revereud Matthew Roohe. Thia
hoeuoe, in the Itinerary (p. 287), ie dated 1634 ; but as he was in the
Austrian camp all that year, and aa he statae that iu 1630 he left Ireland
for the third time, I believe thatthe date of 1634 isa typographical error
