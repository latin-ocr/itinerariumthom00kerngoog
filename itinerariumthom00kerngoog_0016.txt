He now resolved to transfer his services, as chaplaiu, to Walter De·
vereux, formerly the chief officer, aud now the successoros Butler3 end
who was the honoured murderer of Wallenstein. On Devereux's reco-
very from a wound received at the bloody battle ol No'rdlingen, Carne
accompauied him to the siege of Augsburg, aud, on its surrender, into
Lorrainc, whose Duke was struggling with the Freuch. Charles III.
os Lorraine found incarne a warm admirer and au energeticviudicator,
whose continual epithets sor him are, ‘⁴ this hero,” “ the magnanimous
Duke,’' aud “ that lightning ofbattle.” Carne reached the Dukc's army
alittle after Ecaten 1635, and continued with it in its various border·

do not think he made use of the letter till some months later.

In September, 1638, he first heard os the commotions arisiug at home,
and he ejaculstes a prayer that his countrymen would submit to the rule
of “ the most just king in Europe.'’ In the opening of 1639, he aud
Devereux, with some friends, iuspected a J ewish synagogue at Fridberg
in Hesse3 aud the Itinerary (chap. 34) gives a curicus description of
the visit, and the unconsciously insolent deportmentof Corve.

With this narretiou he ended the manuscript of Part Ι. of the Itinerary, ¹
in April, 1639, aud had it priuted at Mente, with a dedication to the
Marquis of Ormond. At this work he had been coustantly engaged
